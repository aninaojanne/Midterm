WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE?

History of data science

While the term data science is not new, the meanings and connotations have
changed over time. The word first appeared in the ’60s as an alternative name
for statistics. In the late ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the
term. A proposed definition for data science saw it as a separate field with three
aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. It still took another decade for the
term to be used outside of academia.

Data Science

is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes,
algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured,
semi-structured and unstructured data.

is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of roles and
requires a range of skills.

What is data science used for?

1. Descriptive analysis

Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is
happening in the data environment. It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie
charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives.

2. Diagnostic analysis

Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why
something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery,
data mining, and correlations. Multiple data operations and transformations may be
performed on a given data set to discover unique patterns in each of these techniques.

3. Predictive analysis

Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that
may occur in the future. It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning,
forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In each of these techniques,
computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.

4. Prescriptive analysis

Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is
likely to happen but also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze
the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action.
It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and
recommendation engines from machine learning.

What are the data science techniques?

Classification

is the sorting of data into specific groups or categories. Computers are trained to identify and
sort data. Known data sets are used to build decision algorithms in a computer that quickly
processes and categorizes the data.

Regression

is the method of finding a relationship between two seemingly unrelated data points. The
connection is usually modeled around a mathematical formula and represented as a graph or
curves. When the value of one data point is known, regression is used to predict the other data
point.

Clustering

is the method of grouping closely related data together to look for patterns and
anomalies. Clustering is different from sorting because the data cannot be accurately
classified into fixed categories. Hence the data is grouped into most likely relationships.
New patterns and relationships can be discovered with clustering.

Emerging technologies in Data Science

Internet of Things (IoT)

Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence(AI)

AR/VR Systems

WHAT ARE DATA AND INFORMATION?

Data

defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a
formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication,
interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machines.

It can be described as unprocessed facts and figures.

Information

is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based.

It is data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to the
recipient and is of real or perceived value in the current or the prospective
action or decision of recipient.

Furtherer more, information is interpreted data; created from organized,
structured, and processed data in a particular context

Data vs. Information

Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.

While data is raw and unorganized, information is organized.

Data, on its own, is meaningless. When it’s analyzed and interpreted, it
becomes meaningful information.

Data does not depend on information; however, information depends on data.

Data isn’t sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based
on information.

Data Processing Cycle

is the re-structuring or re-ordering of data by people or machines to increase
their usefulness and add values for a particular purpose.

Data processing consists of the following basic steps -input, processing, and
output. These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.

Data Processing Cycle

Input – is prepared in some convenient form for processing.

Processing – input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form.

Output – the result of the processed data.

DATA TYPES AND THEIR
REPRESENTATION

In computer science and computer programming, for instance, a data type is
simply an attribute of data that tells the compiler or interpreter how the
programmer intends to use the data.

Data types from Computer programming perspective

Integers(int)- is used to store whole numbers, mathematically known as integers

Booleans(bool)- is used to represent restricted to one of two values

Characters(char)- is used to store a single character

Floating-point numbers(float)- is used to store real numbers

Alphanumeric strings(string)- used to store a combination of characters and numbers

Data types from Data Analytics perspective

Structured Data - is data that adheres to a pre-defined data model and
conforms to a tabular format with a relationship between the different rows
and columns.

Semi- structured Data - form of structured data that does not conform with the
formal structure of data models and contains tags or other markers.

Unstructured Data – is information that either does not have a predefined
data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner.

ADVANTAGES OF STRUCTURED DATA

Easy to use for business users

Extensive tools support

Instantly usable

Disadvantages of Structured Data

Data preparation

Not flexible

Requires dedicated tools

DATA VALUE CHAIN

DATA VALUE CHAIN

The Data Value Chain is introduced to describe the information flow within a
big data system as a series of steps needed to generate value and useful
insights from data.

The Big Data Value Chain identifies the
following key high-level activities:

Data Acquisition

Data Analysis

Data Curation

Data Storage

Data Usage

Data Acquisition

It is the process of gathering, filtering, and cleaning data before it is put in a
data warehouse or any other storage solution on which data analysis can be
carried out.

It is one of the major big data challenges in terms of infrastructure
requirements.

Data Analysis

It is concerned with making the raw data acquired amenable to use in
decision-making as well as domain-specific usage.

It involves exploring, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of
highlighting relevant data, synthesizing and extracting useful hidden
information with
high potential from a business point of view.

Data Curation

It is the active management of data over its life cycle to ensure it meets the
necessary data quality requirements for its effective usage.

Its processes can be categorized into different activities such as content
creation, selection, classification, transformation, validation, and preservation.

Data Storage

It is the persistence and management of data in a scalable way that satisfies
the needs of applications that require fast access to the data.

The most prevalent forms of data storage are file storage, block storage,
and object storage, with each being ideal for different purposes.

Data Usage

It covers the data-driven business activities that need access to data, its
analysis, and the tools needed to integrate the data analysis within the
business activity.

It enhance competitiveness in business decision making

Basic concepts of Data

What is Big Data

Big Data’ is similar to ‘ small data’, but bigger in size.

But having data bigger requires different approaches:

-Techniques, tools, and architecture

An aim to solve new problems or old problems in a better way

Big Data generates value from the storage processing of very large quantities
of digital information that cannot be analyzed with tradition computing
techniques.

Three Characteristics of Big Data

Volume
(Data Quantity)

A typical PC might have had 10 gigabytes of storage in 2000.

Today, Facebook ingests 500 terabytes of new data everyday

Boeing 737 will generate 240 terabytes of flight data during a single flight across
the US

The smart phones , the data they create and consume; sensors embedded onto
everyday objects will soon result in billions of new, constantly-updated data feeds
containing environmental, location and other information, including video

Velocity
(Data Speed)

Clickstreams and ad impressions capture user behavior at millions of events
per second.

Machine to machine processes exchange data between billions of devices

Infrastructure and sensors generate massive log data in real time

Online gaming systems support millions of concurrent users, each producing
multiple inputs per second.

Variety
(Data types)

Big Data isn’t just numbers, dates and strings. Big data is also geospastial
data, 3d data, audio and video, and unstructured text. Including log files and
social media

Traditional database systems were designed to address smaller volumes of
structured data, fewer updates or a predictable, consistent data structure.

Big Data analysis includes different types of data

What is Cluster Computing

Cluster computing refers that many of the computers connected on a network and they perform
like a single entity. Each computer that is connected to the network is called a node. Cluster
computing offers solutions to solve complicated problems by providing faster computational
speed, and enhanced data integrity.

Cluster computing goes with the features of:

All the connected computers are the same kind of machines

They are tightly connected through dedicated network connections

All the computers share a common home directory

Types of Cluster Computing
As clusters are extensively utilized in correspondence to the complexity of the information, to manage
content and the anticipated operating speed. Many of the applications that anticipate high availability
without a reduction in downtime employ the scenarios of cluster computing. The types of cluster computing
are:

Cluster load balancing

High–Availability clusters

High-performance clusters

What is Hadoop

Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently
store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to
petabytes of data. Instead of using one large computer to store and
process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to
analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.

What is Hadoop example?

What is Hadoop example?

For example, when a customer tries to buy a mobile phone, then it
suggests a customer for the mobile back cover, screen guard.
Also, Hadoop helps retailers to customize their stocks based on the
predictions that came from different sources such as Google search,
social media websites, etc.

What is Hadoop and its types?

It is the most commonly used software to handle Big Data. There
are three components of Hadoop. Hadoop HDFS - Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS) is the storage unit of Hadoop. Hadoop
MapReduce - Hadoop MapReduce is the processing unit of Hadoop.
Hadoop YARN - Hadoop YARN is a resource management unit of
Hadoop
