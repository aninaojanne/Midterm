History of biotechnology
People have been harnessing biological processes to improve their quality of life for some 
10,000 years, beginning with the first agricultural communities. Approximately 6,000 years ago, 
humans began to tap the biological processes of microorganisms in order to make bread, alcoholic
 beverages, and cheese and to preserve dairy products. But such processes are not what is meant 
 today by biotechnology, a term first widely applied to the molecular and cellular technologies
  that began to emerge in the 1960s and ’70s. A fledgling “biotech” industry began to coalesce
   in the mid- to late 1970s, led by Genentech, a pharmaceutical company established in 1976
    by Robert A. Swanson and Herbert W. Boyer to commercialize the recombinant DNA technology
     pioneered by Boyer, Paul Berg, and Stanley N. Cohen. Early companies such as Genentech, 
     Amgen, Biogen, Cetus, and Genex began by manufacturing genetically engineered substances 
     primarily for medical and environmental uses.

For more than a decade, the biotechnology industry was dominated by recombinant DNA technology,
 or genetic engineering. This technique consists of splicing the gene for a useful protein
  (often a human protein) into production cells—such as yeast, bacteria, or mammalian cells 
  in culture—which then begin to produce the protein in volume. In the process of splicing 
  a gene into a production cell, a new organism is created. At first, biotechnology investors 
  and researchers were uncertain about whether the courts would permit them to acquire patents
   on organisms; after all, patents were not allowed on new organisms that happened to be discovered
    and identified in nature. But, in 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 
    resolved the matter by ruling that “a live human-made microorganism is patentable subject matter.”
     This decision spawned a wave of new biotechnology firms and the infant industry’s first investment 
     boom. In 1982 recombinant insulin became the first product made through genetic engineering to 
     secure approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, dozens of
      genetically engineered protein medications have been commercialized around the world, 
      including recombinant versions of growth hormone, clotting factors, proteins for stimulating 
      the production of red and white blood cells, interferons, and clot-dissolving agents.

Approaches and tools
In the early years, the main achievement of biotechnology was the ability to produce naturally
 occurring therapeutic molecules in larger quantities than could be derived from conventional 
 sources such as plasma, animal organs, and human cadavers. Recombinant proteins are also less
  likely to be contaminated with pathogens or to provoke allergic reactions. Today, biotechnology
   researchers seek to discover the root molecular causes of disease and to intervene precisely
    at that level. Sometimes this means producing therapeutic proteins that augment the body’s
     own supplies or that make up for genetic deficiencies, as in the first generation of biotech 
     medications. (Gene therapy—insertion of genes encoding a needed protein into a patient’s 
     body or cells—is a related approach.)

The biotechnology industry has also expanded its research into the development of traditional
 pharmaceuticals and monoclonal antibodies that stop the progress of a disease. Successful 
 production of monoclonal antibodies was one of the most important techniques of biotechnology 
 to emerge during the last quarter of the 20th century. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies
  and their availability in quantity have made it possible to devise sensitive assays for an 
  enormous range of biologically important substances and to distinguish cells from one another
   by identifying previously unknown marker molecules on their surfaces. Such advances were made
    possible through the study of genes (genomics), the proteins that they encode (proteomics),
     and the larger biological pathways in which they act.

Applications of biotechnology
Biotechnology has numerous applications, particularly in medicine and agriculture. Examples
 include the use of biotechnology in merging biological information with computer technology 
 (bioinformatics), exploring the use of microscopic equipment that can enter the human body 
 (nanotechnology), and possibly applying techniques of stem cell research and cloning to replace
  dead or defective cells and tissues (regenerative medicine). Companies and academic laboratories 
  integrate these disparate technologies in an effort to analyze downward into molecules and also 
  
  to synthesize upward from molecular biology toward chemical pathways, tissues, and organs.


In addition to being used in health care, biotechnology has proved helpful in refining 
industrial processes through the discovery and production of biological enzymes that spark
 chemical reactions (catalysts); for environmental cleanup, with enzymes that digest
  contaminants into harmless chemicals and then die after consuming the available 
  “food supply”; and in agricultural production through genetic engineering.

genetically modified organisms
genetically modified organisms
Agricultural applications of biotechnology have proved the most controversial. Some 
activists and consumer groups have called for bans on genetically modified organisms
 (GMOs) or for labeling laws to inform consumers of the growing presence of GMOs in 
 the food supply. In the United States, the introduction of GMOs into agriculture 
 began in 1993, when the FDA approved bovine somatotropin (BST), a growth hormone
 that boosts milk production in dairy cows. The next year, the FDA approved the first
  genetically modified whole food, a tomato engineered for a longer shelf life. 
  Since then, regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere has
   been won by dozens of agricultural GMOs, including crops that produce their own
    pesticides and crops that survive the application of specific herbicides used to kill weeds.

Studies by the United Nations, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the European 
Union, the American Medical Association, U.S. regulatory agencies, and other organizations 
have found GMO foods to be safe, but skeptics contend that it is still too early to judge 
the long-term health and ecological effects of such crops. In the late 20th and early 
21st centuries, the land area planted in genetically modified crops increased dramatically,
 from 1.7 million hectares (4.2 million acres) in 1996 to 180 million hectares 
 (445 million acres) by 2014. By 2014–15 about 90 percent of the corn, cotton, 
 and soybeans planted in the United States were genetically modified. The majority
  of genetically modified crops were grown in the Americas.

Overall, the revenues of U.S. and European biotechnology industries roughly doubled 
over the five-year period from 1996 through 2000. Rapid growth continued into the 21st 
century, fueled by the introduction of new products, particularly in health care.
 By 2020 the biotechnology market size was estimated at $752.88 billion globally,
  with new opportunities for growth emerging in particular from government- and 
  industry-driven efforts to accelerate drug development and product-approval processes.
